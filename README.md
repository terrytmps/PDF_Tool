# PDF Management and File Conversion Tool

This project provides a tool for managing PDF files and converting files into different formats.

### Generate Executable for Windows

To automatically generate the executable for Windows, run the following script:

```bash
./windows_executable.sh
```

After creation, the executable file will be located in the `dist/` folder under the name `main.exe`.

To execute the script on Windows, "poppler" needs to be installed. The installation guide can be found [here](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Creating Dummy PDFs

Run the `create_pdf.sh` script:

```sh
./create_pdf.sh
```
